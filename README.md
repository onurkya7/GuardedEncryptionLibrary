## Encryption Algorithms 

Below you can find a short description of each algorithm:

- **CAST-128**: CAST-128 is a fast and reliable block cipher algorithm.
  
- **IDEA**: IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm) is a block cipher algorithm known for its simplicity and security.

- **AES**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a reliable and widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm.
  
- **Blowfish**: Blowfish is a block cipher algorithm preferred for its flexibility and speed.

- **DES**: DES (Data Encryption Standard) is an older but still used encryption standard in some applications.

- **RC4**: RC4 is a fast and simple stream cipher algorithm used for stream encryption.
